To recreate this figure: ![alt text](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1872-width/20170415_WOC921.png)

The figure was published online [here](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/04/06/a-global-decline-in-smoking-masks-regional-variations-between-the-sexes) by The Economist.

## Finding the dataset online 
    - The data was requested at http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2017/data-input-sources?page=65&components=6&risks=98
    - Tended to the supplementry material for the paper, there are subheadings called data sources. 
    - I followed the link,on the link it appears that the 2015 data has been removed but 2017 is remaining. Go into the 2017 link. 
    - Then click on the link for Data Input Sources Tool. On that page, at the bottom click on the drop down arrow by components
    - Select "Risk factors". Under Locations leave as "Global" and under Risks type in "Tobacco"
